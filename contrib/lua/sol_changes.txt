In order to user sol with non-installed Lua version these changes are
required to the sol.hpp file:

Around line 800 (now around 1600) #include <lua.hpp> needs to be replaced with:
#ifndef lua_h
#include <lua.hpp>
#endif

also there is another one on line 1635

Also if you get more errors "lua.hpp not found" also replace other
instances of "#include <lua.hpp>"
